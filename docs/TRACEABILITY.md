# Proposal → implementation traceability

Maps every numbered commitment in *AEGIS-Care v4.0* to the code that implements it and the
test that verifies it. Intended for mentor review and for the reproducibility appendix of
the final paper.

## 5. Proposed system

| 5.2 | Three role-separated agents with distinct authorized functions | `policy/rbac.py::ROLE_FIELD_MATRIX`, `agents/runtime.py` | `test_foundations.py::TestPolicy` |
| 5.3 | Versioned memory object: id/version/owner, content_ref, parent commitments, patient/role/purpose, sketch, replay recipe, status, signature | `memory/models.py::MemoryArtifact` | `test_foundations.py::TestMemoryLedger` |
| 5.4 | Scoped recovery capsule with exactly the declared fields | `care/capsule.py::RecoveryCapsule`, `ALLOWED_CAPSULE_FIELDS` | `test_care.py::TestCapsules` |

## 12. Technology stack

| Proposal layer | Proposed | Used here | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent runtime | Python 3.11, FastAPI, lightweight orchestrator | ✅ as proposed | custom orchestrator, no LangGraph dependency |
| Clinical sandbox | MedAgentBench Docker / HAPI FHIR | synthetic FHIR R4 fixture with same APIs | permitted by gate G0; no Docker needed |
| Memory store | SQLite, append-only version/event tables | ✅ as proposed | `memory/store.py` |
| Primary model | Qwen3-8B or comparable, temperature 0 | deterministic composer by default; OpenAI-compatible adapter provided | guarantees replay determinism |
| Sketch encoder | frozen embedding + random projection + quantisation | frozen hashing encoder + keyed projection + int8 | byte-reproducible across machines |
| Lineage/calibration | scikit-learn logistic regression, calibration | ✅ used in the privacy attacks and calibration report | `eval/privacy.py`, `eval/stats.py` |
| Integrity | SHA-256 commitments, Ed25519 signatures | ✅ via `cryptography` | `util/crypto.py` |
| Policy | deterministic RBAC/ABAC from EICU-AC | ✅ as proposed | `policy/rbac.py` |
| Evaluation | PyTest, frozen JSON traces, paired bootstrap, Pandas/Matplotlib | ✅ as proposed | `eval/`, `tests/` |
| Interface | Streamlit or React dashboard (stretch) | vanilla-JS dashboard served by FastAPI | no build step, runs offline |

## Deviations from the proposal

Each is a deliberate, documented choice rather than an omission.

1. **Synthetic FHIR fixture instead of the MedAgentBench Docker image.** Feasibility gate G0
   explicitly permits this. The search API surface, resource shapes, and task families
   match; the record content is synthetic. Swapping in the real sandbox means replacing
   `fhir/store.py` behind the same interface.
2. **Deterministic composer as the default model.** Section 9.3 asks for temperature zero;
   this goes further and removes sampling entirely, which makes all 900 condition runs
   exactly reproducible. The real-model path is implemented and selectable.
3. **Hashing sketch encoder instead of a downloaded sentence transformer.** Preserves the
   "frozen encoder + random projection + quantisation" structure while keeping runs
   byte-identical across machines and removing a network dependency.
4. **Signatures exclude mutable lifecycle state.** Necessary so an origin attestation
   survives the state transitions recovery performs; state changes are separately signed in
   the ledger.
5. **All five deterministic predicates from Section 5.5.2 confirm influence**, not just
   patient and resource-id changes. Restricting to the latter silently missed families F3
   and F4 — see the design note in the README.

## Version 5 evidence and hardening addendum

| Version 5 claim | Implementation | Verified by / evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Load third-party FHIR JSON, directories, and zip archives; preserve patient-bearing bundles and normalise `urn:uuid` references | `fhir/loader.py::load_fhir_sources` | `test_external_validation.py::test_external_fhir_reference_normalisation_and_recovery` |
| Run the nine paired recovery conditions on public Synthea-shaped data | `eval/external.py::run_external_validation`, CLI `external-validate` | `results/external_validation/results.json`, `report.md` |
| Bind evidence artifacts, command, environment, data hashes, results, and limitations by SHA-256 | `eval/evidence.py` | `test_external_validation.py::test_evidence_manifest_detects_tampering`, `evidence_manifest.json` |
| Recover a stale corrected fact when targeted masking and prose shift defeat ordinary similarity | scoped support tokens in `util/crypto.py`, `care/capsule.py`, `care/candidate.py` | targeted F4 assertion in `test_external_validation.py` |
| Keep support tokens privacy-bounded | receiver/incident scoping, bounded count, local-only overlap, API redaction | `api/app.py::_capsule_public`, capsule field/audit tests |
| Expose evidence tiers, integrity status, exact limitations, and latest result to reviewers | `api/app.py::/api/evidence`, `web/` Evidence Center | API tests plus served-dashboard smoke check |

The public-data run is an **external-format mechanism validation on synthetic records**. It
does not establish clinical effectiveness, hospital interoperability, regulatory
compliance, or patient benefit.
